# About me
I'm a full-stack web developer working in Boston startups since 2018. My primary stack is Javascript / Typescript with React in the front end and Node/Express and Python / Flask on the backend. My software development education was at the Resilient Coders boot camp (2017-Boston, MA) and as a fellow at Recurse Center (2021-NY). I also freelance through my business Rafart Tech LLC (https://rafart.tech)
